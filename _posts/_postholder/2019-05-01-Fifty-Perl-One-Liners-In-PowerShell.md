Peter Krumins has [a collection of "Fifty Perl 1Liners"](https://catonmat.net/ftp/perl1line.txt)
and I've been wondering how many of them would translate to PowerShell,
and how nicely they would translate.

The table of contents is:

    1. File Spacing
    2. Line Numbering
    3. Calculations
    4. String Creation and Array Creation
    5. Text Conversion and Substitution
    6. Selective Printing and Deleting of Certain Lines    
    7. Handy Regular Expressions
    8. Perl tricks
