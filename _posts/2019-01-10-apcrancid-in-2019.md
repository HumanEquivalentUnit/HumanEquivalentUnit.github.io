title: Using rancid-apc (apcrancid) module in RANCID 3.8

The tool [RANCID from Shrubbery Networks, inc.](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) 
will login to network switches and get their current configuration,
'diff' it against previous configuration, email you with any changes,
and save the configuration to a version control system (cvs, svn or git).

Modules can add support for different manufacturers,
HP, Arista, Juniper, and many kinds of devices - 
if it has an SSH, telnet, or ftp interface and can list its configuration to text,
it's probably workable.

APC UPS management cards have network interfaces for monitoring, 
and APC environment monitoring units have as well,
and there is a third party module [rancid-apc.tar.gz](ftp://ftp.shrubbery.net/pub/rancid/contrib/)
in their unsupported contrib folder.

It was built for RANCID v 2.x and the newer RANCID 3.x range works differently.

To get it working, I:

 - extracted the .tgz
 - edited the `apcrancid` file and changed `#! /usr/bin/perl5` to `#! /usr/bin/perl` 
 (find out where perl is with `which perl` or `locate perl`)
 - edited the `apclogin` file and changed `#! /usr/local/bin/expect --` to `#! /usr/bin/expect --`
 - copied both `apclogin` and `apcrancid` to `/usr/local/rancid/bin/` and make sure they are `chmod +x`
 - the `rancid.fe` file has totally changed in v3.x, so don't copy it over or try to apply the patch.
 
 Instead edit `/usr/local/rancid/etc/rancid.types.conf` wherever you installed it, and add:
 
 ```
apc;script;apcrancid
apc;login;apclogin
```

Then add these devices like any other to your `routers.db` file, with the type `apc`. 

That seems to be enough for this to work with 3.8.
